  <strong>to-do-list</strong> allows you to create, read, update, and delete tasks using localHost so it saves to your computer. It allows you to make projects and mark off tasks.

  Everyone makes a to-do list at some point in their web development career, and I'm part of everyone so here's mine. (haha)

## Code Notes

- Just learned about a bunch of JavaScript fundamentals like the SOLID JavaScript principles, modules, factory functions, module patterns, IIFE, and I hope to use as much of them as I can while building this project.
- I might even try bringing in [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) -- I don't know anything about it so it'll be like me going out into the wild and capturing an exotic animal and taming it.
